# Showcasing issue with Flutter Quill editor in a scrollview

To replicate issue, click and hold in the text field on iOS then release to view the 'paste' option. Paste a bunch of text in the editor and it'll create an error. ALSO, select a word and move the start or end selectors to view another error. \r\n\r\nI need this to work because I'll end up having multiple Quill editors in a listview all with unknown heights.
